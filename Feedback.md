## ToolBox Feedback
#### ToolBox Word Frequency Analysis:
I enjoyed this particular toolbox, but it was a little bit redudant since it was extremely similar to our mini project three. However, it was a nice option to have if people were interested in an easier toolbox. If I were to improve it, I would make it that students would have to one step more of their choice that analyzes the text, such as the most unique words or the most common words above a certain length.

#### ToolBox Image Stenagraphy:
  This was one of my favorite toolboxes because it made the participant have a desirable end goal which was to decode a secret message. In addition, I thought that the topic itself was interesting. I particularly enjoyed how their was some scaffolding to the code, but that there was not too much that would make it too simple.

#### ToolBox Web Apps:
  I had a lot of fun doing this toolbox because creating your own website gives you a lot of creativity as to how the website looks like or what it does. I spent a lot of time simply changing arbitrary things. However, if I were to change something I would give a little more structure in the beginning as opposed to simply sending us to random websites.
  
#### ToolBox Machine Learning:
  I had chosen this toolbox in order to prepare myself for a project on machine learning, but this toolbox did not inform much about what machine learning or what different machine learning algorithms were. Rather, I plotted and analyzed a certain data structure. This toolbox would be better if there was maybe a little less scaffolding, or if it was pivoted in a different direction.
  
#### ToolBox Pickling:
  This toolbox was extremely helpful for one of the first mini-projects as it explained how to pickle and what pickling is. I honestly think not much can be done to improve this toolbox, because it was informative. However, it is true that it is not the most engaging topic despite its usability.
  
#### ToolBox Geocoding:
  I decided to do this toolbox as my final toolbox because I wanted to better understand how to access APIs. I really enjoyed doing this toolbox, because it really enlightened me about what exactly and API is and how I would be able to access it if it contained data that I needed. If it were to be improved, I might have students go through a more complicated API, so they understand how difficult they can be.
